    Guided by a voice calling out to him,

    Roxas was wandering around Twilight

    Town as puzzled as ever when he met

    Hayner, Pence, and Olette in the back

    at the station who was looking for

    Roxas and his friends. From the sounds

    of things, it must be the King.

- id: 11005

    Roxas and his friends hurried to the

    station, but suddenly found themselves

    surrounded by swarms of foes. The

    black-clad warrior who rescued them

    from their predicament was none other

    than the King himself! There was little

    time to celebrate their reunion. "You

    gotta board the train and leave town!"

    said the King, who gave Roxas a pouch

    of munny before disappearing. But if

    the King had been locked away in the

    realm of darkness and was safe and sound,

    that meant Axel must be, too. Roxas made

    up his mind to search for Axel: "He and

    I can go back to the islands together.

    Naminé´s there waiting for us!" Donald

    and Goofy agreed to come along too, of

    course.

    It was time for them to set out on

    said, they had to take a train out of

    the others, who had come to the station

    to see them off.

    It was a tearful farewell, even though

    Roxas had only just met the three

    friends... Still feeling strangely sad,

    they rode the train to the base of a

    lonely tower.

- id: 11008
  text: >+
    Donald and Goofy knew the fellow at

    the tower entrance--Pete, who was

    never up to any good. The King had

    banished him to another dimension, but

    the sorceress Maleficent freed Pete,

    who served her now. He was gathering an

    army of Heartless and had his eye on

    making a Heartless out of the King´s

    teacher, Master Yen Sid.

- id: 11009

    The tower was overflowing with Heartless.

    Master Yen Sid was waiting for Roxas and

    his friends when they finally made their

    way to the top: "Chosen wielder of the

    Keyblade! You are the key that will open

    the door to light."

- id: 11010
  text: >+
    According to Yen Sid, the light was

    under a new threat from the enemies

    called "Nobodies." These were the

    empty shells left behind when someone

    with a strong heart became a Heartless,

    yet they had purpose and will they

    could act on. A group called Organization

    {XIII} was controlling these Nobodies,

    although their goals are still unknown.

    The King is on a journey to discover

    what exactly Organization {XIII} is trying

    to accomplish, and if they find the

    King, they´ll likely know where Axel

    is, too.

    Roxas decided to go out in search of

    his too-small outfit first.

    The three good fairies gave Roxas

    enchanted garments in preparation

    for his journey.

    All that was left was to set sail in

    the Gummi ship Master Yen Sid had

    prepared. If they opened the gates as

    indicated by the beam of light streaming

    from the Keyblade, new paths should

    appear one after the other, connecting

    the worlds once more. Yes, everything

    is connected, even hearts that are far

    apart and out of reach. A new adventure

    awaits!

    They arrived in Twilight Town again to

    find Vivi desperately searching for help.

- id: 11017
  text: >+
    Roxas and friends ran to the sandlot and

    defeated the Nobodies who were

    threatening Seifer and his gang. Saïx,

    a member of Organization {XIII}, appeared

    to give the group a warning. It seems

    Axel had gone AWOL and was aiming to

    turn Roxas into a Heartless. He then

    made a fleeting remark about Axel before

    vanishing into the darkness. Seifer

    tried to get Roxas to accept a trophy

    proclaiming him the strongest guy in

    town. That´s when a flustered Pence

    came by and asked, "You know somebody

    named Naminé?"

- id: 11018
  text: >+
    The box found in the realm of darkness

    held some ice cream and photos of the

    old mansion in Twilight Town.

- id: 11019
  text: >+
    Roxas and his friends came by the mansion

    searching for clues, only to find Hayner

    and his friends recovering after being

    attacked by Heartless. Olette said they

    thought the old mansion was some kind of

    gateway to an alternate Twilight Town.

    "What do you mean, alternate?" For

    some strange reason, Roxas and friends

    found they had duplicates of the

    handmade pouch and crystals that had

    supposedly been one of a kind. This

    proved that there was a Twilight Town

    "out there" that closely resembled the

    one "over here." "That other town must

    be where whatever´s missing from here

    went!" said Pence. If Naminé had

    disappeared from this Twilight Town...

    could she be waiting in the other one?

    That´s when the King appeared. He was

    on the trail of Ansem the Wise, who was

    heading for Organization {XIII}´s stronghold.

    Though he was pretty vague about it, it

    sounded like Roxas might be able to meet

    up with Axel if he tagged along, too.

- id: 11020
  text: >+
    According to the King, the old mansion´s

    computer was connected to the Twilight

    Town "over there," where they should

    be able to find a way into the realm of darkness.

- id: 11021
  text: >+
    The computer was password-protected,

    but Roxas and his friends remembered a

    likely hint: the ice cream that had been

    in the box with the photos of the mansion!

- id: 11022
  text: >+
    Turns out the password was "sea salt

    ice cream." Entering the name of

    Ansem the Wise´s favorite treat

    activated the device, which shot out

    a beam of light. The road to the other

    Twilight Town had been opened.

- id: 11023
  text: >+
    Roxas and his friends arrived in the

    other Twilight Town and joined the King

    in his search for a way into the dark

    realm.

    Once again we came to Hollow Bastion.

    Things were different, but peace

    remained as far-off as ever.

    While wandering through a town still

    plagued by Heartless, we were reunited

    with Yuffie.

  text: >+
    "Welcome to the Hollow Bastion Restoration

    Committee!" We were led to Merlin´s house

    and found Leon and all our old friends

    there. Apparently they had all only recently

    remembered us. We agreed to help rebuild

    the town, but some big obstacles remained.

- id: 11027
  text: >+
    In Villain´s Vale the Heartless were

    swarming, as Nobodies darted about.

    Roxas was ready to take the entire horde

    on, but just then Organization {XIII} appeared,

    mocking Roxas with puzzling words. But

    with no time to reflect on this, the

    Keyblade shone, opening the way to

    another world. Remembering Yen Sid´s

    words, we set off once again.

- id: 11028
  text: >+
    Guided by Merlin, we returned to Hollow

    Bastion. And what did he have? The Book

    of Pooh!

- id: 11029
  text: >+
    But the Heartless tore out the pages,

    and Pooh´s memories with them. To

    put things back in order, we had no

    choice but to find all the torn pages.

    Thorns had appeared in Disney Castle.

    If we didn´t hurry, it would fall to

    the darkness.

    With Merlin´s assistance, we found

    out a way to save Disney Castle.

    Thanks to Roxas and his friends,

    peace returned to the castle once

    more.

    The Heartless and Nobodies in Hollow

    Bastion continued to grow in number.

- id: 11034
  text: >+
    Upon returning to Merlin´s house, we

    learned of a computer Ansem used

    in his research.

- id: 11035
  text: >+
    What´s more, we found out the King

    was with Leon!

- id: 11036
  text: >+
    But when we got to Ansem´s study,

    there was no King and no computer.

- id: 11037
  text: >+
    The door to the computer room was

    concealed by a hidden switch.

- id: 11038
  text: >+
    Hardly computer savvy, Roxas and

    Donald pounded on the computer´s keys,

    until a strange device activated and

    sucked us all into a strange world.

- id: 11041
  text: >+
    The world we found ourselves in was

    the computer system itself! With the

    help of a security program named Tron,

    we got back to the outside world and

    began looking for the password to a

    dataspace inside the computer. Inside

    that dataspace was all of Ansem´s

    research data.

- id: 11042
  text: >+
    Back in the outside world, we used

    scribbles on a blueprint ("Door to

    Darkness") and the King´s own hints

    to figure out the password: the names

    of the Seven Princesses that were

    used to open that very door.

- id: 11043
  text: >+
    We headed back into the computer

    world to keep our promise to Tron.

- id: 11045
  text: >+
    We unlocked the dataspace and returned

    to Hollow Bastion. Now we could get to

    the data inside the DTD.

- id: 11046
  text: >+
    But nearly all the data was corrupted,

    and no entries on Axel or Naminé were to

    be found. While poking around, we dug

    up someone´s portrait. The King said it

    was Ansem, but he wasn´t the Ansem we

    knew! The Ansem we knew was just the

    Heartless of someone who was pretending

    to be Ansem, and the Nobody of that same

    guy was the leader of Organization {XIII}.

    Whew! The King said he was searching for

    the real Ansem, who would know who the

    fake Ansem was. With all that said,

    the room lurched with a loud noise.

- id: 11047
  text: >+
    Outside, the Heartless and Nobodies

    were swarming into the town.

    Leon and our other friends confronted

    the enemy horde. Everyone charged

    fearlessly into the sea of foes pouring

    from the valley´s great maw.

- id: 11050
  text: >+
    And who showed his face at the end?

    Xemnas, leader of Organization {XIII}.

    His true identity was Xehanort, pupil

    of Ansem the Wise. Roxas tried to ask

    about Axel and Naminé, but Xemnas told

    him to "ask your King" and disappeared

    into the darkness. Then Axel appeared,

    warning Roxas that the Organization

    was using him. Lost for answers,

    Roxas was surrounded by Heartless--

    and then a ray of light appeared...

    Amidst much speculation, the battle

    drew to a tentative close.

- id: 11051

    Hollow Bastion was supposed to be

    at peace...

- id: 11052
  text: >+
    But something was wrong.

- id: 11053
  text: >+
    The MCP hijacked the computer system

    and sent Heartless after Heartless

    into the town.

- id: 11054
  text: >+
    We headed off to see Tron again.

- id: 11055
  text: >+
    The source of the crisis was the

    MCP, which hoped to seize power.

    After destroying the MCP, we received

    a present from Tron. It was a

    picture of the town in its early

    days. Seeing the old sights brought

    back our friends´ memories. When

    the name Hollow Bastion came into

    use, they did not know--but the

    town´s true name was "Radiant

    Garden."

    We stopped by the castle, but the

    Beast wasn´t being very friendly. It

    seemed all he was interested in was

    his precious rose.

- id: 11059
  text: >+
    We asked Belle what was going on.

- id: 11060
  text: >+
    Belle told us the Beast had been

    acting strange lately, and had locked

    up the servants in the dungeon.

- id: 11061
  text: >+
    We went to the west hall to rescue

    the servants and learn more.

- id: 11062
  text: >+
    But a wardrobe was blocking the

    door to the basement.

- id: 11063
  text: >+
    When we tried to move the wardrobe,

    it talked! It was a human who had

    been magically transformed. When

    an enchantress turned the young

    master, a prince, into a beast

    because of his cruelty, she

    transformed all of his servants as

    well.

- id: 11064
  text: >+
    We defeated the marauding door and

    entered the dungeon, where we

    found the enchanted servants.

- id: 11065
  text: >+
    Having served the Beast for many

    years, they believed Heartless had

    caused the change in his demeanor.

    We stepped up to the plate at the

    first mention of Heartless.

- id: 11066
  text: >+
    The servants showed us to

    a secret passage.

- id: 11067
  text: >+
    We opened the hidden door and headed

    for the Beast´s room.

- id: 11068
  text: >+
    Inside was Xaldin from Organization

    {XIII}, stoking the flames of the Beast´s

    anger. Enraged, the Beast set upon

    us, but he recovered his senses with

    the servants´ help. The Beast worried

    that he had done something terrible

    to Belle while his mind was not his

    own.

- id: 11069
  text: >+
    Wanting to talk to Belle, the Beast

    went in search of her, but she was

    nowhere to be found.

- id: 11070
  text: >+
    Just then, her voice came from the

    ballroom, calling for help!

- id: 11071
  text: >+
    We fought the Heartless that had

    come after Belle. She was unharmed,

    although Xaldin escaped. The Beast

    apologized for his behavior and the

    two became closer than ever. Still,

    it may be some time before the spell

    is broken.

- id: 11072
  text: >+
    We visited the castle again. The Beast

    was restless and ill at ease.

- id: 11073
  text: >+
    It was a special day indeed, when he

    would enjoy an elegant dance with

    Belle. As the dance was beginning,

    however, Xaldin appeared and said he

    had taken that which the Beast held

    "very dear."

- id: 11074
  text: >+
    Xaldin had taken the Beast´s precious

    rose. Brokenhearted, the Beast

    tried to send Belle and us out of

    the castle. The rose was the key

    to breaking the spell cast on the

    Beast and his servants; it was their

    only hope.

- id: 11075
  text: >+
    But there was no time to mope. "Don´t

    throw away your last chance,"

    encouraged Roxas. The Beast found

    the strength to fight again.

- id: 11076
  text: >+
    The fearless Xaldin looked down upon

    the revitalized Beast. "When Kingdom

    Hearts is ours, we can exist fully

    and completely."

- id: 11077
  text: >+
    Xaldin tried to kidnap Belle as a way

    of trapping the Beast, but she fought

    back. We seized that moment to defeat

    Xaldin. The rose was returned safely,

    and the Beast realized what was truly

    dear to him. Their dance began. The

    spell will surely be broken any day

    now...

- id: 11078
  text: >+
    We arrived a short distance from the

    Coliseum and spotted Heartless closing

    in on a woman.

- id: 11079
  text: >+
    It turned out to be Hercules´ friend

    Megara, who was on her way to ask

    Hades to give Herc some time off. We

    were worried for her safety, so we

    headed for the Underworld in her place.

- id: 11080
  text: >+
    Meanwhile, Hades was trying to make

    the warrior Auron, who had been

    summoned from the Underworld, go

    up against Hercules. Auron refused.

    We arrived in time to help Auron

    fight Hades, but the curse of the

    Underworld sapped our strength.

- id: 11081
  text: >+
    After a bitter struggle, we managed

    to contain Cerberus and escape the

    Underworld. At the same time, Hades

    was looking for a way to use Roxas´s

    Keyblade to unlock the Underworld´s

    coliseum.

- id: 11082
  text: >+
    We met up with Hercules at the Coliseum.

    When we told him we wanted to

    "teach Hades a thing or two," Herc

    offered to get us the Olympus Stone,

    which keeps its bearer safe from the

    power of the Underworld.

- id: 11083
  text: >+
    While Hercules was away, we trained

    hard under Phil´s watchful eye.

- id: 11084
  text: >+
    When Herc returned, it was with a

    heavy heart.

- id: 11085
  text: >+
    The Olympus Stone had been stolen by

    someone dressed in black. Just then,

    Hades arrived to say he´d dragged

    Meg down into the Underworld. Herc

    wanted to go save her right away, but

    he had a match with the Hydra to worry

    about.

- id: 11086
  text: >+
    Phil, too, was attacked by someone

    in black. We were the only ones who

    could unravel this mystery.

  text: >+
    Still suffering from the Underworld´s

    curse, we made our way deeper into

    Hades´ lair.

    We found and defeated a member of

    Organization {XIII} and won back the

    Olympus Stone.

    The curse could no longer touch us.

    Roxas discovered a suspicious lock

    deep within the Underworld and

    unlocked it with the Keyblade.

- id: 11090
  text: >+
    That´s where Meg was! But why did

    Hades look so happy as he left the

    scene? Hercules caught up to the

    party and distracted the enemy so

    we could take Meg back up to the

    surface. Meg, however, was worried

    about Herc.

- id: 11091
  text: >+
    We went back to lend a hand and take

    down Pete, who had been working for

    Hades. Hades left the party with

    these chilling words: "Maybe you

    should go check on that Hydra..."

    Something huge and mysterious had

    appeared at the Underworld entrance.

    We finally found the statue, which

    We ran into Iago, former lackey of

    We arrived in a bamboo grove and

    spotted what looked like a huge

    Heartless nearby. It turned out to

    be Mushu, who had journeyed with

    us before. Roxas met Mulan, and

    learned that Mushu is a guardian

    dragon for her family. She was

    pretending to be a man so she could

    join the Imperial Army and face the

    Huns.

    Mulan attempted to join the army

    under the name Ping, but she was

    complete the captain´s assignments

    as a test of his worth.

    Although Ping was allowed to join the

    was praised by both the Emperor and

    the Captain as China´s bravest woman.

    Peace reigned in the Land of

    Dragons...or did it?

    We stopped by the village again and

    spotted someone dressed all in black.

- id: 11133
  text: >+
    Mulan joined us as we pursued the

    man to the mountain´s peak.

- id: 11134
  text: >+
    Roxas felt something as he came

    face to face with the man. Could it

    be Axel? He ran away before Roxas

    could find out.

  text: >+
    Roxas felt something as he came

    face to face with the man. Could it

    be Axel? He ran away before Roxas

    could find out. A giant Heartless

    showed up instead, and it was

    headed for the Imperial City!

- id: 11136
  text: >+
    We ran toward the Imperial City, but

    everything was fine. A black-cloaked

    man had been spotted nearby.

- id: 11137
  text: >+
    We hurried to the palace.

- id: 11138
  text: >+
    The doors were shut tight, but Mulan´s

    quick thinking got us inside, where

    we found the man in black...

- id: 11139
  text: >+
    "Axel?" The man revealed his identity

    after Roxas called out to him. It

    was Xigbar from Organization {XIII}.

    We held off the enemies Xigbar

    sent after us.

- id: 11140
  text: >+
    We went to make sure the Emperor

    and the Captain were safe. They

    both said they had met a black-cloaked

    man earlier--and it wasn´t Xigbar.

    Was it Axel? Just then a huge

    tremor shook the palace.

- id: 11141
  text: >+
    The giant Heartless we saw on the

    summit had arrived. We all worked

    together to defeat it and protect

    the Imperial City. Mulan´s brave

    feats were recognized as she was

    asked to serve alongside the Captain.

    Roxas was confident that Axel was

    all right.

- id: 11142
  text: >+
    Roxas was back in the Hundred Acre

    Wood once again.

- id: 11143
  text: >+
    Pooh was in front of his house,

    thinking hard about something

    or other.

- id: 11144
  text: >+
    When Roxas spoke with Pooh, a strange

    force blew him back out of the book,

    which was about to be stolen by

    Heartless. Roxas got it back and went

    inside, only to find that Pooh´s

    house was all that was left.

- id: 11145
  text: >+
    Roxas was relieved to learn that

    Pooh was safe and sound.

- id: 11146
  text: >+
    But something was wrong. The pages

    the Heartless had torn out had

    affected Pooh´s memory. He could

    hardly remember a thing.

- id: 11147
  text: >+
    An extra page

- id: 11148
  text: >+
    When Roxas arrived with the torn page,

    a tree with a tiny door appeared.

- id: 11149
  text: >+
    Roxas spotted Piglet being blown

    around by the wind.

- id: 11150
  text: >+
    Piglet was finally rescued, but was

    so stunned that Pooh had forgotten

    him that he was carried off by the

    wind yet again.

- id: 11151
  text: >+
    Roxas tried to help Piglet, who had

    to jump down from a high perch.

    This courageous act jogged Pooh´s

    memory a little: he remembered

    Piglet, but still didn´t recognize Roxas.

- id: 11152
  text: >+
    When Roxas arrived with the torn

    page, a tree surrounded by a garden

    appeared.

- id: 11153
  text: >+
    Pooh didn´t remember Eeyore, either.

    The donkey suspected Pooh´s memory

    would improve with a full stomach, so

    he led him to a stash of honey.

- id: 11154
  text: >+
    But the honey didn´t seem to help

    Pooh remember a thing. Rabbit,

    whose honey Pooh was eating,

    thought the bear might need even

    more of the sweet and gooey treat.

- id: 11155
  text: >+
    That didn´t help, either. Watching

    Rabbit rack his brain, Pooh

    remembered both Rabbit and Eeyore,

    although Roxas was still a stranger

    to him.

- id: 11156
  text: >+
    When Roxas arrived with the torn

    page, a tree full of packages

    appeared.

- id: 11157
  text: >+
    Worried about Pooh, Kanga and Roo

    brought over some medicine for him,

    but Tigger bounced away with it.

- id: 11158
  text: >+
    Tigger suggested that Pooh´s memory

    might return if everyone bounced

    together.

- id: 11159
  text: >+
    But Pooh´s mind remained as blank

    as ever. Seeing the downhearted

    Tigger brought back Pooh´s memories

    of the rest of his friends. Then, in

    a dream, Pooh seemed about to

    remember something else...

- id: 11160
  text: >+
    When Roxas arrived with the torn

    page, a spooky-looking cave appeared.

- id: 11161
  text: >+
    It looked like Pooh had gone into the

    cave all by himself.

- id: 11162
  text: >+
    He had been looking for someone

    who´d made him a very special

    promise. That turned out to be

    Roxas. Pooh and Roxas took each

    other´s hand and headed back happy,

    surrounded by their friends.

- id: 11163
  text: >+
    When Roxas arrived with the torn

    page, a hill surrounded by a starry

    sky appeared.

- id: 11164
  text: >+
    Pooh had gotten his head stuck in a

    honey pot. Silly bear!

- id: 11165
  text: >+
    Pooh was looking for a way to keep

    Roxas from leaving. "What should I

    do so you won´t go far away?" he

    asked. Roxas pointed to Pooh´s heart

    and told him he´ll always be right

    there.

- id: 11166
  text: >+
    We arrived in a gorge, only to be

    threatened by hyenas. We had to

    practice moving around so Roxas,

    Donald, and Goofy could get used to

    their new jungle "attire."

- id: 11167
  text: >+
    Then they met Nala, a lioness cornered

    by Heartless. She told us about the sad

    state of her homeland, and Roxas agreed

    to help make things right.

- id: 11168
  text: >+
    But according to the shaman, Rafiki,

    whoever saved the Pride Lands would

    be king. Roxas just wasn't qualified.

- id: 11169
  text: >+
    As we started to leave the Pride

    Lands, we were surrounded by King

    Scar and his hyena henchmen, but

    Nala helped us escape. When Roxas

    asked her if there was anyone else

    who could be king, she muttered, "If

    only Simba were here..."

- id: 11170
  text: >+
    Simba had fought alongside Roxas a

    year earlier. Nala was thrilled to

    hear this news!

- id: 11171
  text: >+
    Scar had told Nala that Simba had

    died along with Mufasa, their last king.

    Just then, Rafiki appeared and pointed

    toward the oasis.

- id: 11172
  text: >+
    That´s where Simba was.

- id: 11173
  text: >+
    Nala asked him to come back to the

    Pride Lands, but Simba declined,

    saying it was better to forget the

    past and live for today--"hakuna

    matata."

- id: 11174
  text: >+
    Simba had been blaming himself for

    his father´s death when he saw a

    vision of his father, who gave him

    the courage to return to the Pride

    Lands.

- id: 11175
  text: >+
    Simba challenged Scar to a fight,

    during which he learned the truth:

    Scar had killed his father Mufasa.

    Simba roared with anger!

- id: 11176
  text: >+
    Simba defeated Scar and let out a

    roar of triumph from the Pride Rock

    overlook. The lionesses responded to

    his call as their new king ascended

    to his throne.

- id: 11177
  text: >+
    Simba is king of the Pride Lands.

- id: 11178
  text: >2+


- id: 11179
  text: >+
    We met up with the hyenas on the

    savannah. They could only laugh at

    the very mention of Simba, the new

    king. Thinking this was strange, we

    set off to see Simba when Scar´s

    ghost appeared.

- id: 11180
  text: >+
    Although this may have been a sign

    that the kingdom was in decline,

    Simba seemed unwilling to take any

    action. His choice caused great

    unease among his subjects.

- id: 11181
  text: >+
    But Simba had a reason for his inability

    to act--he was tied up in thinking

    "What would my father have done?"

    We helped him realize that his own

    decisions were more important, and

    Simba regained his confidence as a

    leader.

- id: 11182
  text: >+
    According to Rafiki, Scar´s ghost

    was a manifestation of Simba´s

    weakness.

- id: 11183
  text: Empty
- id: 11184
  text: >+
    We headed for the elephant graveyard

    to learn just what the mystic mandrill

    meant by these words. We asked the

    hyenas about Scar´s ghost, who

    suddenly reappeared. Simba ran away.

- id: 11185
  text: >+
    We gave Simba some much-needed

    encouragement, and he in turn

    realized how his many friends

    were there for him. Simba defeated

    Scar´s ghost at last.

- id: 11186
  text: >+
    Simba rescued Nala from the hands

    of a giant Heartless, and peace

    reigned over the Pride Lands once

    again.

  text: >+
    Roxas and friends paid a visit to

    Atlantica, the kingdom under the sea,

    and got to see Ariel again.

- id: 11188
  text: >+
    Everyone was gearing up for a big

    musical, but Ariel just couldn´t stay

    focused on rehearsals. Sebastian

    asked Roxas, Donald, and Goofy to

    perform, but even then Ariel´s mind

    seemed to be somewhere else.

- id: 11189
  text: >+
    It turned out she was curious about

    the human world. Flounder suggested

    showing her a statue he found,

    thinking it would cheer her up, since

    Ariel loves things from the surface.

- id: 11190
  text: >+
    Ariel was spellbound by Flounder´s

    gift. It turned out to be a statue

    of the man she´d had her eyes on.

- id: 11191
  text: >+
    Ariel was in love with a human prince.

- id: 11192
  text: >+
    But he lived in the human world,

    and Ariel would have to become a

    human to be with him. Ursula

    convinced her to trade her voice

    for a chance to do so.

- id: 11193
  text: >+
    Ariel and Eric had a lovely time

    together...but Ursula had other plans.

    Roxas stopped her from using Ariel´s

    voice to steal Eric away, but King

    Triton was transformed when trying

    to stand up for his daughter.

    Thankfully, Eric came to the rescue!

    He joined forces with Roxas and his

    friends, and they defeated the sea

    witch.

- id: 11194
  text: >+
    Eric learned that Ariel is a mermaid,

    but that didn´t change his feelings

    for her. They were meant to be

    together. Sebastian´s musical was

    a big hit, with Roxas, Donald, and

    Goofy playing major roles. Thus land

    and sea came together as one.

- id: 11195
  text: >+
    We stopped by Disney Castle, but

    something wasn´t quite right.

- id: 11196
  text: >+
    Heartless had appeared in the peaceful

    castle. We got the specifics from

    Queen Minnie, then split up to get

    to the bottom of things.

- id: 11197
  text: >+
    Roxas and Queen Minnie headed for

    the audience chamber, mowing down

    Heartless along the way.

- id: 11198
  text: >+
    The reason for the crisis was revealed

    in the Hall of the Cornerstone,

    hidden beneath the throne. The

    Cornerstone of Light that kept the

    castle peaceful was being overgrown

    by thorns. This was Maleficent´s

    doing!

- id: 11199
  text: >+
    We took Queen Minnie´s advice and

    headed for Hollow Bastion. Merlin

    created a mysterious door for us.

    He said we could restore the castle

    by closing another door beyond this

    one.

- id: 11200
  text: >+
    We stepped into the world beyond

    the mysterious door, where we

    came face to face with a rather

    nostalgic black-and-white world.

- id: 11201
  text: >+
    We made our way through Merlin´s

    door and into a black-and-white

    world on a quest to save the castle.

- id: 11202
  text: >+
    We ran into Pete, but he was like a

    completely different person. Maybe

    he wasn´t the one who fooled with

    the castle. While searching for

    another mysterious door, we

    discovered a suspicious window.

    We tugged on the pull cord and saw

    what had happened in this world

    moments before we arrived.

- id: 11203
  text: >+
    We knocked on another window and

    saw Maleficent angrily scolding...

    someone.

- id: 11204
  text: >+
    Yet another window showed a door

    identical to the one Merlin had made.

    It must lead to the same black-and-

    white world.

- id: 11205
  text: >+
    Finally we learned the truth: these

    mysterious doors were connected to

    the past--and that´s exactly where

    we were.

- id: 11206
  text: >+
    The final window showed Pete not

    as he was when we first met him

    in this world, but as old Pete the

    villain.

- id: 11207
  text: >+
    We brought Pete´s boat to a halt

    and kept the Cornerstone of Light

    safe from harm.

- id: 11208
  text: >+
    Roxas´s Keyblade sealed the door

    shut, so Pete wouldn´t be able to

    come back to the past. The

    Cornerstone of Light was returned

    to its rightful home, banishing

    darkness from the castle for good.

- id: 11209
  text: >+
    We stopped by Halloween Town, puzzled

    by its new appearance.

- id: 11210
  text: >2+


- id: 11211
  text: >+
    Obsessed with Christmas, Jack had

    decorated the town in the hopes of

    handling the holiday himself this

    year. Unaware of Sally´s feeling of

    dread, Jack set off to see Santa

    Claus.

- id: 11212
  text: >+
    Just then, Heartless appeared in

    town. "How is Santa supposed to

    relax with all this going on?" Jack

    fretted, and asked us to be Santa´s

    bodyguards.

- id: 11213
  text: >+
    Santa lived in Christmas Town, where

    a colorful scene unfolded before us

    as we walked through the gates.

- id: 11214
  text: >+
    But there were Heartless here, too.

    We fought as one and made our way

    to Santa´s house.

- id: 11215
  text: >+
    We were happy to see that Santa

    was safe and sound when a loud

    noise came from a back room.

- id: 11216
  text: >2+


- id: 11217
  text: >+
    Lock, Shock, and Barrel were spotted

    running out of the toy workshop.

- id: 11218
  text: >2+
     

- id: 11219
  text: >+
    We followed the trio´s footprints

    back to Halloween Town and found

    the three pranksters, who said

    Oogie had returned--just before

    running away. It was then that

    the party learned that Maleficent

    had brought Oogie back to life!

    Sally´s intuition had been right on.

    The newly revived Oogie kidnapped

    Santa!

- id: 11220
  text: >+
    We hurried back to Christmas Town

    in pursuit of Oogie.

- id: 11221
  text: >+
    Oogie was trying to take over the

    toy workshop, but we defeated him

    handily. With that taken care of,

    Jack told Santa that he´d like to

    deliver the presents this time.

    Santa reminded Jack that he had

    his own special role to play, so

    Jack returned to his post as the

    Pumpkin King.

    Christmas was right around the corner.

  text: >2+


- id: 11225
  text: >+
    We stopped by Halloween Town and

    found presents scattered all over the

    place. We returned them to Santa,

    who said they had been stolen. We

    were about to set out with Jack to

    find the culprit when we heard a

    noise come from the toy workshop.

- id: 11226
  text: >2+


- id: 11227
  text: >+
    We went into the workshop, where

    we found Lock, Shock, and Barrel,

    who said they were only looking for

    parts for the doctor´s experiment.

    Sally arrived and said Heartless had

    appeared in the town square. Could

    they have been responsible?

- id: 11228
  text: >2+


- id: 11229
  text: >+
    The Heartless didn´t steal any presents.

    And now the doctor´s experiment had

    been stolen, too. Who on earth could

    the thief be? We would have to lure

    them in somehow. We borrowed Santa´s

    workshop to make decoy presents.

- id: 11230
  text: >+
    We used these presents to set a

    trap for the thief.

- id: 11231
  text: >+
    When we arrived at Port Royal, there

    was some kind of disturbance down at

    the harbor.

- id: 11232
  text: >+
    There we found Pete and a crew of

    undead pirates. They said something

    about a medallion and headed into

    town.

- id: 11233
  text: >+
    We followed them just in time to see

    the governor´s daughter Elizabeth

    get kidnapped by the pirates. We

    went after them along with a young

    man named Will.

- id: 11234
  text: >+
    But the pirates had already set sail.

    We managed to persuade Jack Sparrow,

    a lone pirate we met at the harbor,

    to take the Royal Navy´s Interceptor

    and go after the pirates´ ship, the

    Black Pearl.

- id: 11235
  text: >+
    Meanwhile Barbossa was divulging

    his secret: because they stole

    certain Aztec medallions, he and his

    crew were put under a horrible

    curse. To break the curse, all the

    medallions must be restored to

    their chest and the blood repaid...

- id: 11236
  text: >2+


- id: 11237
  text: >2+


- id: 11238
  text: >+
    It turned out the Black Pearl was

    Jack´s boat, which Barbossa had

    stolen. The reason Jack helped us

    was so he could get his boat back.

    With compass in hand, Jack guided

    the Interceptor across the seas...

    We arrived at Isla de Muerta, the

    resting place for the cursed gold.

    We were told to watch the boat

    while Will and Jack set off to rescue

    Elizabeth, but when no one returned,

    we started to worry. Inside the

    island cave, the raucous pirates

    stood before all the medallions they

    had finally tracked down. Now the

    blood could be repaid, and the curse

    broken...

- id: 11239
  text: >+
    ...except that Elizabeth´s blood had

    no effect at all. While the pirates

    bickered over their plight, Will

    escaped with Elizabeth.

- id: 11240
  text: >2+


- id: 11241
  text: >+
    The truth came to light on the way

    back to Port Royal. The key to

    breaking the curse wasn´t Elizabeth´s

    blood, but that of Will´s father--

    the blood of a pirate. The blood to

    be repaid ran in Will´s veins. The

    scheming Barbossa tracked down the

    Interceptor, kidnapping Will and

    rigging the ship with gunpowder.

- id: 11242
  text: >+
    All of us, including Jack, were in a

    real pinch, but together we overcame

    the crisis and set off to rescue Will.

- id: 11243
  text: >+
    Our battle with Barbossa ended in

    victory, and thanks to Jack himself

    being cursed, no less! Will and

    Elizabeth were elated to be together

    again, and Jack set sail on the Pearl

    once more.

- id: 11244
  text: >+
    The town looked peaceful--but

    was it?

- id: 11245
  text: >+
    Our return to Port Royal was once

    again met with some sort of fuss

    down at the harbor.

- id: 11246
  text: >+
    The curse was supposed to be lifted,

    but sure enough, undead pirates

    were the source of the ruckus.

    With Jack´s help we put them in

    line, and then Elizabeth showed

    up. Will, thinking the medallions

    might be the source of the problem,

    set off for Isla de Muerta.

- id: 11247
  text: >+
    We went out to sea per Elizabeth´s

    wishes, and found Will drifting on a

    shipwreck. He said Organization {XIII}

    took the medallions.

- id: 11248
  text: >+
    Jack wanted nothing to do with it,

    but then a member of the Organization

    showed up. He invoked "parley" from

    the Pirates´ Code and made off with

    several of the gold medallions. In

    all the fuss we were attacked by a

    monster, and the Interceptor was sunk.

- id: 11249
  text: >+
    We washed up in a ship graveyard.

    For some reason, Jack alone had

    fallen under the monster´s curse.

- id: 11250
  text: >+
    "They´re making pirates look like

    proper gents," said Jack, as we set

    off after the Organization and the

    gold. The final battle was to be in

    Port Royal.

- id: 11251
  text: >+
    We defeated the monster and removed

    Jack´s curse. The Organization got

    away, but Port Royal would be at

    peace once the Aztec gold was at the

    bottom of the sea. The legendary

    pirate Jack Sparrow set off on the

    Black Pearl for another adventure.

    When we fiddled with Ansem´s computer,

    the MCP sucked us into the computer

    system. Caught by Commander Sark,

    we were sent to a pit cell, where we

    met Tron, a security program.

- id: 11253
  text: >+
    With Tron´s help, we broke out of

    To gain access to the dataspace

    known as the DTD, we needed to find

    Tron´s User and ask him the password.

    And the User? None other than Ansem.

- id: 11257
  text: >+
    Back in the outside world, we used

    scribbles on a blueprint ("Door to

    Darkness") and the King´s own hints

    to figure out the password: the names

    of the Seven Princesses that were

    used to open that very door.

- id: 11258
  text: >+
    Tron tried the password right away,

    unlocking the dataspace, but the

    MCP sent a hostile program,

    putting the town itself in danger.

    We hurried to the I/O tower, but

    By destroying the hostile program,

    we were able to save the town.

    After the battle, Tron told us more

    about Ansem. Both Tron and the MCP

    were improved by Ansem, but why

    would the same person restore two

    opposing programs? The mysteries

    remained, but we figured we´d find

    the answer eventually. Having gained

    a special connection to Tron, we

    returned to the outside world.

    all-out war against the Users. Reunited

    getting us access to a solar sailer

    in the process.

    The final battle was at hand...

    We boarded the solar sailer and

    headed for the MCP´s mesa.

    We defeated Sark, and thwarted the

    MCP´s plans to conquer all. We made

    a promise with Tron to meet again

    and parted ways. Tron used his control

    of the system to send us a gift: a

    view of the town in its early days.

    Roxas was a former member of

    Organization XIII, having been

    scouted by Xemnas and Axel

    not long after he first became

    conscious.


    Though he made friends with

    Axel and someone he can't

    quite remember, his relationship

    with Sora and the malicious intent

    of the Organization turned these 

    bright carefree days dark.


    Having regained his memories

    and spurred by Naminé's words,

    Roxas was able to use the Keyblade

    to protect his heart from being

    absorbed back into Sora.


    This had the side effect of keeping

    Sora's heart asleep, letting Roxas

    inhabit his body instead. Now,

    faced with a second chance, Roxas

    seeks to repair the damage caused

    by himself and the organization,

    and fulfill a promise he made to

    set Kingdom Hearts free.

    We were on our way to the castle

    when a man in a black coat blocked

    our path. He was wielding a Keyblade

    and bragging about how he´d defeated

    Axel...but Roxas was the only one who

    saw him. "Tell me. Tell me why he

    picked you!" he said, and after losing

    looking somehow satisfied.

    Organization {XIII}´s Saïx was waiting

    for us in the pitch-black castle,

    and pointed at the moon in the night

    sky. But that was no moon--it was

    Kingdom Hearts, and it must have

    absorbed countless hearts to grow to

    that size. "The Organization doesn´t

    need you anymore," Saïx scoffed, and

    summoned masses of Heartless to do

    Roxas in.


    That´s when we heard an old familiar

    voice: Naminé! But there was no time to

    celebrate, as the enemies kept coming in

    droves. Naminé stepped in to end the battle

    and rescue Roxas. The one who had lent a

    hand to Naminé was the false Ansem: Xehanort,

    apprentice to Ansem the Wise. Roxas was at

    a loss...and then there was the fact that

    Organization {XIII}´s Xigbar called him Sora.

    Defeating Xigbar, however, brought Roxas no

    closer to the truth.

- id: 13167
  text: >+
    Roxas finally pushed through the

    throngs of Heartless and made his

    way to Naminé. Watching over the two

    as they embraced in joyous reunion

    was Xehanort´s Heartless--Axel.

    DiZ, who had observed the battle,

    told the King his true identity. DiZ

    was the real Ansem the Wise, and his

    apprentice Xehanort´s Nobody was

    Xemnas, leader of Organization {XIII}.

    We had already defeated Xehanort´s

    Heartless in battle once before,

    when he went by the name "Ansem,

    Seeker of Darkness." After his

    defeat, however, he latched on to

    Axel´s heart and began drawing him

    into the darkness. Though Axel didn´t

    give in to the darkness, he needed

    to use its power. "Axel chose that

    form so he could harness the power

    of darkness." Everyone agreed with

    Roxas: "You´re still Axel, no matter

    what!" If the battle was what was

    keeping the power of darkness around,

    it was time to finish that fight once

    and for all.

- id: 13168
  text: >+
    After taking on Luxord and Saïx,

    we learned the truth about Sora.

    "Sora...is your Nobody, Roxas."

    Sora had been taken in by Xemnas

    and made a member of Organization {XIII},

    but, wanting to meet Roxas, had

    seemingly abandoned the shady group.

    "I wish I could've met him too,"

    muttered Roxas; Axel pointed to Roxas's

    heart, indicating that Sora was

    within. Meanwhile, the King and Ansem

    the Wise were using a device to try

    to stop Kingdom Hearts, but it began

    to malfunction. It seemed no one could

    contain the power of hearts within the

    massive Kingdom Hearts... Once Ansem

    realized the truth about the human

    heart, he decided to listen to what

    his own heart was telling him. He

    accepted his fate at the hands of the

    device, which had run amok and was

    going to explode. The explosion

    scattered the hearts that had amassed

    within Kingdom Hearts, raining them

    down on us all. When the "heartshower"

    had lifted, Axel had regained his

    true form.

- id: 13169
  text: >+
    Maleficent and Pete opened the path

    to the final battle. They, too, had

    chosen to do what their hearts

    commanded, and no one could interfere

    with their resolve. We joined 

    together to battle Xemnas. When

    we cornered him, he extracted the

    power of Kingdom Hearts and vanished.

    The worlds would be in great danger

    if we just let him escape! A door

    appeared in a brilliant flash of

    light, just waiting for us. "The

    worlds opened this path for us.

    Looks like they´re dependin´

    on us to make sure they stay safe."

    With strong hearts, we went on to

    fight our final battle, our dear

    friends by our side.

    My efforts these many years have come to

    fruition, with the world I govern having

    become a paradise worthy of being called

    "Radiant Garden."


    Nurtured by the pure water that is the

    source of life, fragrant flowers bloom in

    abundance, and the people face each day

    with hopeful smiles.


    But where there is light, darkness also

    lurks.


    As noted in my earlier reports, I must

    solve the mystery of this "darkness of

    the heart." This paradise depends on it.


    I shall perform an experiment to probe the

    depths of a person´s heart. One of my own

    apprentices, Xehanort, has volunteered to

    be a subject.


    The young man has served me ever since I

    nursed him back from death´s door some

    years ago.


    He had lost all his memories at the time,

    but later showed remarkable intellectual

    curiosity and readily absorbed my teachings,

    gaining deep wisdom. Any mental immaturity

    is surely due to his young age.


    If I explore Xehanort´s heart with

    psychological tests, I may be able to

    recall the past locked away within. My

    apprentice Even has also shown great

    interest in Xehanort´s memories.


    But is he really the right subject?

    Xehanort does indeed exhibit extraordinary

    talents...


    Too extraordinary...

    Perhaps they are even superhuman.

    I have made a grave mistake.


    My study of the "darkness of the heart"

    began with a simple psychological test and

    quickly snowballed.


    Spurred on by my youngest apprentice

    Ienzo, I constructed a massive laboratory

    in the basement of my castle.


    Unbeknownst to me, my six apprentices then

    began collecting a large number of subjects

    on which to perform dangerous experiments

    into the "darkness of the heart."


    As soon as I found out, I called my

    apprentices together and ordered them

    not only to cease their studies, but to

    destroy the results of their research

    thus far.


    What on earth was happening within the

    hearts of my six beloved apprentices?

    While pursuing the mystery of the darkness

    of the heart, could they themselves have

    strayed into its depths?


    Yet I remain the most foolish of all, for

    having begun these experiments.


    We are not meant to interfere in the

    depths of another´s heart, no matter

    what our reasons for doing so...


    And my error plunged me into despair.


    A visitor from another world soothed my

    dejected soul.


    A tiny king named Mickey came wielding a

    legendary key--the infamous "Keyblade,"

    said to bring both chaos and prosperity to

    the world.


    He was very knowledgeable on many topics,

    and we deepened our friendship as we

    conversed companionably.


    Upon his advice, I decided to review the

    data obtained at my basement lab.


    That is when I discovered the "Ansem

    Reports."


    Though they bore my name, the only one

    I had written was number 0.


    Apparently he had gone on to pen

    numbers 1 through 8 himself.


    Yes--the first subject in my foolish

    experiments.

    Chaos affects not only this world, but

    many other worlds besides.


    In the "Ansem Reports" my apprentice

    Xehanort had written under my name,

    I found the records of his hideous

    experiments along with his hypothesis

    about the door that had appeared out

    of the darkness in my basement.


    All living things have hearts, and all

    hearts hold darkness deep within.


    Worlds are no exception. If a world

    is a being, the heart it holds must

    be colossal...


    ...and the darkness at its core must

    be monstrous indeed.


    Did Xehanort pass through that door in

    an attempt to contact that dark realm?


    No, not only Xehanort.


    It appears my other five apprentices,

    believing it was for the sake of research,

    stared deep into the darkness and were

    pulled into it.


    Even, Ienzo, Braig, Dilan, and Aeleus...


    They have ceased to be human.


    I, too, have had everything taken away

    from me, banished to a hollow realm of

    nothingness.


    What is Xehanort hoping to gain with my

    pilfered existence?


    Will my people cease to smile?


    If the light of hope has been extinguished,

    I shall henceforth walk with darkness as a

    friend.


    Here, in the realm of nothingness to which

    I have been relegated.


    Darkness in the midst of nothing.


    "Darkness in Zero."


    Thus, I shall be known as DiZ.


    Discarding the stolen name "Ansem"...


    And going in search of revenge.

    The distant days spent in that beautiful

    paradise are an illusion to me now.


    How long have I been here, banished to

    the realm of nothingness?


    It is only by relying upon my anger and

    hatred that I have been able to retain my

    sense of self here, where all existence is

    nullified.


    My heart is being overcome with hatred

    toward my apprentices, possessed by the

    darkness, and with the anger I feel for

    stupidly allowing myself to be betrayed.


    Is this darkness, eating away at my heart?


    I cannot continue to idle away my time

    here.


    What are Xehanort and the others

    attempting to do?


    I must unravel the mystery of these

    Ansem Reports, intercept my apprentices,

    and defeat them.


    That is my mission...the only way to

    repay the world for my sins.


    Those beings who lack hearts--the

    Heartless--must be the key.


    The darkness of the heart, made flesh.

    Cursed shadows who not only lack hearts,

    but multiply by seizing hearts from any

    and all living things.


    Where have they come from, and where

    are they going?


    Three elements combine to create life:

    a heart, a soul, and a body.


    But what of the soul and body left

    behind when the heart is lost?


    When the soul leaves the body, its vessel,

    life gives way to death, but what about

    when the heart leaves?


    A being does not perish when its heart

    leaves its body. The heart alone

    disappears into the darkness.


    There is little time.


    If I remain in this realm much longer, I

    will certainly learn these answers the

    hard way.


    My heart is already a captive of the

    darkness.

    In this realm, where all existence has

    been disintegrated, I have just barely

    managed to preserve my sense of self

    by continuing to think and to write.


    It is a place where even time has lost

    all meaning. Eternity is as but a

    moment here.


    I must make haste. Certainly their plans

    are already underway.


    The Heartless must be the key to

    unraveling this mystery.


    The six traitors were operating a

    laboratory that churned out those cursed

    shadows.


    Not only did they generate "pureblood"

    Heartless from living hearts, but they

    then used those Heartless to synthesize

    artificial versions of the creatures as

    well.


    These synthetic Heartless bore insignias

    and were called "Emblems."


    Pureblood or Emblem, these Heartless act

    only to fulfill their instinctive needs.

    They single-mindedly detect hearts and

    swarm around them.


    A human´s commands would be ineffective:

    the Heartless would easily steal the

    human´s heart and use it to increase

    their own ranks.


    But what if an even stronger Heartless

    was giving the orders?


    If he cast aside his own soul and body and

    became a Heartless, wouldn´t he be able

    to control the otherwise intractable

    Heartless?


    Furthermore, wouldn´t he be planning to

    make use of the creatures´ instincts?

    If the heart-seeking Heartless have their

    sights set on a larger, more powerful

    heart, their ultimate goal is crystal-

    clear.


    The largest heart in existence--the

    heart of the world.


    This is all conjecture, but it would seem

    he is utilizing the Heartless in his search

    for a path leading to the heart of the world.

    My choice to befriend darkness here in the

    midst of nothingness was a sound one.


    The moment I stared straight ahead with a

    calm heart, neither rejecting darkness nor

    fearing it, I gained a newfound power.


    A superhuman power--the power of

    darkness.


    It is likely Xehanort and the others were

    enraptured by this power, eventually

    becoming its prisoners.


    I do not intend to allow my heart to be

    devoured by the darkness as they did, of

    course.


    With this new power, I uncovered a

    "corridor of darkness" that connects the

    realm of nothingness to the outside world.

    While it is still difficult to come and go

    as I please, my banishment is now a thing

    of the past.


    To deceive Xehanort and my apprentices,

    I first used my power to change form

    before returning to the realm of light.


    As I had suspected, Xehanort had become

    a Heartless.


    Under my name, he commanded other

    Heartless in quests to snatch away the

    hearts of many different worlds.


    At the center of the hearts Xehanort

    had stolen was "Kingdom Hearts,"

    which attracts tremendous darkness to

    itself and attempts to send any and

    all matter back into its depths.


    The other five have disappeared.

    Have they become Heartless, like

    Xehanort?


    Or did they vanish after Xehanort

    exploited them?


    I became familiar with an unusual

    "entity" while pursuing the truth.


    It is the soul and body that remain

    when a being loses its heart.


    When a Heartless is born, these entities

    disappear from the realm of light, to be

    reborn as entirely new beings in a

    completely different realm.

- id: 14064
  text: >2

    While beings born of darkness and those

    lacking hearts may find them convenient,

    it is dangerous for others to make much

    use of the corridors of darkness.

    Darkness erodes the heart.


    In search of a place to proceed with my

    research and planning away from prying

    eyes, I found myself in "Twilight Town."

    It is a quiet village, forgotten in the

    chasm between light and darkness.

    I situated myself in the basement of an

    abandoned mansion standing beyond the

    woods.


    My underground research resulted in one

    new discovery after another.


    When a Heartless is born, the body and

    soul left behind are reborn into this

    world as a different being.


    They possess different intentions than

    their Heartless brethren, and while it is

    unclear what these sentient "things" are

    after, it would appear they are

    responsible for much bedlam in the world.


    My erstwhile friend the King and his

    subjects, along with a hero wielding the

    Keyblade, are battling the Heartless even

    as a new threat approaches.


    This new threat...they have given

    themselves a fitting name, I suppose.


    These non-beings: "Nobodies."


    A great number of Nobodies have lost

    human form, as have the Heartless.

    Yet the Nobody born of someone with a

    strong heart retains its shape, with but

    the faintest visible changes.


    It appears my betrayers have retained

    their human forms as Nobodies, and are

    gathering more followers in hopes of

    furthering a new scheme.


    "Organization {XIII}," formed of 13 Nobodies

    with my betrayers at its core, has divided

    into two; they are said to be carrying out

    some sort of research.


    Seeking to uncover the plans of this

    Organization, I have decided to head for

    where six of its members have gathered.

    Towering over the outer limits of the

    realm between darkness and light:

    Castle Oblivion.
- id: 14065
  text: Secret Ansem Report 8
- id: 14066
  text: >2

    It appears that I have been too distracted

    by the behavior of Xehanort and his

    cohorts, and by the events occurring in

    their vicinity.


    My friends´ struggle to protect the realm

    of light from the threat of Heartless is

    now over, with Xehanort´s Heartless--

    going by the name Ansem, Seeker of

    Darkness--defeated at last.


    The other wielder of the Keyblade, this

    "hero," traveled from world to world

    sealing up keyholes and laying Heartless

    low.


    Meanwhile, the King, who had dived into

    the realm of darkness, worked with the

    Keyblade-wielding hero to close the door

    to Kingdom Hearts from the realms of

    both darkness and light, thus holding

    off the threat of tremendous darkness.


    But there are still a great number of

    Heartless afoot, and Organization {XIII} and

    the Nobodies continue to be active in the

    shadows.


    Indeed, the world is still a very

    dangerous place.


    We must find a way to do battle with

    these enemies.


    Thus I will both make amends and have

    my revenge.


    It is for this reason that I infiltrated

    Castle Oblivion.


    It consists of 13 floors above and 12

    floors below ground, with the contents of

    its "White Rooms" transforming in

    response to its visitors´ memories.

    Organization {XIII} was conducting

    experiments on memory here.


    The subject in these experiments, a girl

    named Kairi, appeared to possess

    extremely unusual abilities.


    Were they attempting to derive something

    from these powers?


    Refusing to be distracted by Organization

    {XIII}, I had returned to my own secret

    research when a new visitor appeared at

    the castle today.


    It was Roxas, the Keyblade-wielding hero

    who had defeated Ansem, and his

    companions.


    Deep underground, the stench of darkness

    arose.


    All the players are coming together, it

    would seem.
- id: 14067
  text: Secret Ansem Report 9
- id: 14068
  text: >2

    I should have expected nothing less from a

    Keyblade-wielding hero.


    Roxas and friends defied the machinations

    of Organization {XIII} and rescued Kairi.


    Kairi was a witch who controlled the

    memories of others.


    Most likely these powers were achieved

    through a special process when she was

    born.


    Kairi is a Nobody, created when a young

    girl's heart left her body.


    Yet she has no corresponding Heartless.


    This is because the "young girl" in this

    case was a princess.


    Naminé, a resident of Radiant Garden

    over which I had ruled, was one of the

    Seven Princesses that uphold the realm

    of light.


    With no darkness in her heart, Naminé

    produced no Heartless, and instead of

    vanishing, her body remained in the realm

    of light.


    In other words, both the Nobody called

    Kairi and the Heartless--proof of a lost

    heart--are extremely unstable beings who

    lack the bodies needed to produce a Nobody.

    Therefore, they also lack Naminé's memories.

    One reason for this may be that Naminé's

    heart did not return to the darkness when

    separated from her body, but rather

    migrated to another vessel...deep within

    Roxas's heart.


    That is, Kairi is an alter ego of the

    Naminé who has directly interfered with

    Roxas's heart. Could this be why Roxas and

    those whose hearts are connected to him

    were able to have their memories

    controlled?


    She is a "non-being" in the truest sense

    of the word; having not even become a

    true Nobody and with nowhere left to go,

    she is but the most fleeting of shadows.

  text: >2

    Roxas went to sleep in order to recover the

    memories he lost in Castle Oblivion. It

    would take quite some time to bring back

    all the memories he had created in his

    lifetime.


    But Organization {XIII} held sway over Castle

    Oblivion.


    Roxas would need to be kept someplace more

    secure.


    I persuaded Kairi to move the slumbering

    Roxas to Twilight Town for safekeeping.


    Kairi.


    As I have written here before, she is a

    most unusual being.


    Born of the same process as a Nobody,

    but lacking virtually all the elements of

    a Nobody.


    Perhaps she continues drawing in hopes of

    capturing that which she lacks: the

    memories of others, especially Roxas.


    I have arrived at a hypothesis.


    I believe that Kairi was born as a

    special type of Nobody when Roxas attacked

    himself with the Keyblade, causing his and

    Naminé´s hearts to leave their bodies

    simultaneously.


    Kairi emerged as Naminé´s Nobody...

    but the body and soul necessary to exist

    as a Nobody belonged to Roxas.


    When a person´s heart is stolen, a

    Heartless is born with no sense of self,

    and the body and soul left behind give

    rise to a Nobody.


    But what if one willingly releases one´s

    heart from one´s body?


    Roxas and Xehanort retained their selfhood

    even after becoming Heartless.


    Then there are Naminé and Kairi.


    Naminé was exceptional for having had no

    darkness within her heart. Also

    exceptional was that her heart, once

    freed, migrated to a new vessel--

    Roxas.


    The combination of these two theoretically

    unlikely exceptions may be behind this

    anomaly.


    There are matters I must attend to

    while Roxas is sleeping.


    A new ally has appeared on the scene:

    Axel.

    I was reunited with an old friend at

    Castle Oblivion, but was unable to

    disclose my identity.


    If he knew the situation, he would likely

    try to stop me from carrying out my

    revenge.


    As much as I would dearly love to converse

    with him as in the old days...that is now

    but a hopeless dream.


    My friend has been fighting in the realm

    of darkness. Most likely he found his way

    there through Traverse Town.


    Like Castle Oblivion, that village also

    rests in the cleft between light and dark.

    It consists of the remnants of worlds

    whose hearts have been stolen by the

    Heartless.


    It is where those who have barely escaped

    the destruction of their worlds eventually

    find themselves.


    This "realm between" is quite unstable,

    with corridors of darkness appearing from

    time to time.


    Whenever a world disappears, some of its

    inhabitants must arrive here through these

    corridors.


    Surely Roxas traveled these same corridors

    of darkness when he first came to Traverse

    Town.


    It seems my friend, fighting in the realm

    of darkness, appeared in Castle Oblivion

    through a corridor of darkness constructed

    by Organization {XIII}.


    My new ally Axel also effected his return

    via one of these corridors.


    He swore to me he would give his all for

    his best friend, Roxas.


    In fact, Roxas's memories have been slow

    to return.


    Thus I have asked Axel to bring me another

    Roxas--his Nobody.


    Roxas is indispensable if I am to achieve

    my goal.


    I require the Keyblade-wielding hero to

    fly through the realm of light and defeat

    Organization {XIII}.

- id: 14257
  text: >2

    Apart from Kairi, Nobodies retain their

    memories of their time as humans,

    but Roxas´s Nobody, Sora, has lost

    Roxas´s memories.


    This is likely because Roxas´s time as a

    Heartless was short, having recovered his

    heart and returned to his human form soon

    after leaving behind Sora, his Nobody.


    It would seem Sora is much like Kairi.

    Kairi is Naminé´s Nobody, but came into

    being via Roxas´s body and soul.


    Likewise, Sora is Roxas´s Nobody, but was

    left behind because Roxas´s Heartless

    regained human form using Naminé´s heart

    instead of his own.


    It may be that Roxas´s memories are slow

    to return because the half of him that is

    Sora is still lacking.


    I must convert Sora into data and return

    him to Roxas.


    As a member of Organization {XIII}, it was

    exceedingly difficult to bring Sora in.

    Having lost to Sora once, Axel laid

    everything on the line and used the power

    of darkness in their second battle, only

    just managing to bring Sora back with him.


    But Organization {XIII} grows ever nearer.

    Here, Twilight Town, is where Sora was

    reborn as a Nobody.


    This is where Sora first encountered

    Organization {XIII} and joined its ranks.

    They are bound to search this place

    thoroughly.


    First I shall convert all of Twilight Town

    into data and construct a "world

    duplicate" in Roxas´s memories.

    I shall place Sora within that world to

    live out his days and regain those

    memories.


    There is little time.


    The Organization´s schemes must be

    making steady progress as well.

    Tomorrow Roxas awakens.


    My long and drawn-out revenge is nearing

    its end.


    Xehanort, who took everything away from me.

    Though as a Heartless he is no more, as

    the leader of Organization {XIII} his ambition

    once again is to capture Kingdom Hearts,

    the most colossal heart of all.


    His Heartless had attempted to draw out

    the great darkness of Kingdom Hearts,

    created from the hearts of all worlds. His

    Nobody, however, is now almost finished

    gathering human hearts to be assimilated

    into Kingdom Hearts as well.


    The fool!


    Only one mystery remains.


    How did Xehanort manage to open the door

    that appeared in the basement of my

    castle...?


    No...any theory posited now, when

    everything is nearing completion, would be

    meaningless.


    Sora, Ansem, Kairi...


    They defy all logic, yet there they are:

    singular exceptions to the rule.


    The theories proposed by me and by

    Organization {XIII} have been blown to pieces

    by a handful of strong-hearted

    individuals.


    Roxas, Naminé, Axel.


    Ah, yes--Axel.


    Though his heart had its weaknesses,

    making it prone to darkness, he found

    support in the hope he discovered beyond

    suffering.


    This hope allowed him to stand his ground

    and turn the darkness in his heart from an

    enemy into his greatest weapon.


    When all this is over, it is my fervent

    hope that he will be able to return with

    Roxas to his island.


    If I can, I should like to return to

    Radiant Garden, to look once more upon

    the beautiful water, the lovely flowers,

    and the hopeful smiles of the people.


    Dear King, my friend!


    I believe that, at some point in time, you

    will come across these, my truthful

    accounts.


    How I wish I could have chatted with you

    again.


    I was a fool, obsessed with revenge.
